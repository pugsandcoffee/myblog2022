## Hello world!
Welcome to my personal blog where I write about my journey into the realm of cybersecurity, ethical hacking and my pug.

This is my first blog and website _ever_. A nice guy named **BHE** from the discord community **#NorSEC** advised me to create my own blog for content creation and sharing. I was also inspired to learn more about shortcodes when my colleague Nelson showed me some notes he had organized in markdown. 

I decided to go with a combination of the static site builder **Hugo, GitHub, and Netlify**. Mostly because I can use markdown to construct the content of my posts and pages but also because of the ease with a serverless app. This also forces me to learn something new, which I enjoy alot.

So far, so good:

- [x] Create a GitHub account and a site repository
- [x] Commit & Update my first site created with Hugo
- [x] Deploy with Netlify & register my own custom domain name
- [x] Write my first blog post

Remaining tasks:

- [ ] Post my first CTF writeup in markdown
- [ ] Create a few more pages with content
